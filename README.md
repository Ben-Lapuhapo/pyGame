# pyGame
To use the PyBadge LED you need to go to https://circuitpython.org/libraries and find 
adafruit_circuitpython-bundle-5.x-mpy-20190930.zip
and press it to download, then go to the folder where you downloaded the zip file
then go to lib and find the following 
*neopixel
*adafruit_bitmap_font
*adafruit_display_shapes
*adafruit_display_text
and move it to the CIRCUITPY folder.
Copy the PYGAME code that I made and go to MU Editor to upload it to  the PYBADGE.
#Remember name the program code.py only.
